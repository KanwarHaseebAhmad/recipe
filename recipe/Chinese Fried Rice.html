    <h2>Decription:</h2>
    <p>Egg fried rice â€¦   they go with any Chinese gravy or dry dish. I like to add just 1 vege in it and that is green onion, usually people add carrots, capsicum, mushroom in it but I like it simple just with eggs and lot of green onions. Try it my way and you would definitely like it ðŸ™‚</p>
